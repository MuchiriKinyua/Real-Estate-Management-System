# Introduction
The following project analyzes the housing sales of King county. It will try to compare how prices are influenced by different features e.g., bathrooms, bedrooms and such. This features will be tested side by side with the price to see their proportion against each other i.e does the increase in feature A lead to increase/decrease in the price. Does it even have an effect to start with. This will enable us to give the stakeholder the visuals and the recommendations to enable him or her to make the necessary conclusions. 
# Problem Statement
The problem statement is to give the stakeholders real estate data which will enable them know where to invest, how to renovate based upon previous patterns which have already occured in the northwestern county real estate business. There is need to identify the trends there in the past and their consequences e.g when the house was put up in front of a water body(waterfront), how fast did it find a customer. Does putting it in front of a waterfront have any positive impact?
# Main Objective
The main objective is to select the features which influence the price of a house mostly and then visualize them and put them on a regression scale based on the past data to construct a predictive model to identify how in the future, what will be influencing the real estate business.
# Specific Objectives
1.4.1. To identify the most correlated features with the price to create a multilinear regreesion to help us in knowing how the features influence the prices and even influence the customers. </br>
1.4.2 To build a baseline model to identify the most relevant data to be used as the starting point of the analysis. </br>
1.4.3 To use the linear regression metrics to have the appopriate coefficients which will enable us to come up with the relevant recommendations for the stakeholders of the real estates
